Because psychometrics is based on latent psychological processes measured 
through correlations, there has been controversy about some psychometric 
measures.[35][page needed] Critics, including practitioners in the physical 
sciences, have argued that such definition and quantification is difficult, 
and that such measurements are often misused by laymen, such as with personality 
tests used in employment procedures. The Standards for Educational and Psychological 
Measurement gives the following statement on test validity: "validity refers to the 
degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores 
entailed by proposed uses of tests".[36] Simply put, a test is not valid unless 
it is used and interpreted in the way it is intended.[37]

Two types of tools used to measure personality traits are objective tests and 
projective measures. Examples of such tests are the: Big Five Inventory (BFI), 
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2), Rorschach Inkblot test, 
Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON-2006,[38] or Eysenck's Personality 
Questionnaire (EPQ-R). Some of these tests are helpful because they have 
adequate reliability and validity, two factors that make tests consistent 
and accurate reflections of the underlying construct. The Myersâ€“Briggs Type 
Indicator (MBTI), however, has questionable validity and has been the subject 
of much criticism. Psychometric specialist Robert Hogan wrote of the measure: 
"Most personality psychologists regard the MBTI as little more than an elaborate 
Chinese fortune cookie."[39]

Lee Cronbach noted in American Psychologist (1957) that, "correlational psychology, 
though fully as old as experimentation, was slower to mature. It qualifies equally 
as a discipline, however, because it asks a distinctive type of question and has 
technical methods of examining whether the question has been properly put and the 
data properly interpreted." He would go on to say, "The correlation method, for its 
part, can study what man has not learned to control or can never hope to control ... 
A true federation of the disciplines is required. Kept independent, they can give 
only wrong answers or no answers at all regarding certain important problems."[40]
