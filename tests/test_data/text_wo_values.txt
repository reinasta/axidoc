Charles Darwin was the inspiration behind Sir Francis Galton, 
a scientist who advanced the development of psychometrics. In 1859, 
Darwin published his book On the Origin of Species. Darwin described 
the role of natural selection in the emergence, over time, of different 
populations of species of plants and animals. The book showed how individual 
members of a species differ among themselves and how they possess 
characteristics that are more or less adaptive to their environment. 
Those with more adaptive characteristics are more likely to survive to 
procreate and give rise to another generation. Those with less adaptive 
characteristics are less likely. These ideas stimulated Galton's interest 
in the study of human beings and how they differ one from another and, more 
importantly, how to measure those differences.

Galton wrote a book entitled Hereditary Genius. The book described different 
characteristics that people possess and how those characteristics make some 
more "fit" than others. Today these differences, such as sensory and motor 
functioning (reaction time, visual acuity, and physical strength), are important 
domains of scientific psychology. Much of the early theoretical and applied for 
work in psychometrics was undertaken in an attempt to measure intelligence. Galton 
often referred to as "the father of psychometrics," devised and included mental 
tests among his anthropometric measures. James McKeen Cattell, a pioneer in the 
field of psychometrics, went on to extend Galton's work. Cattell coined the term 
mental test, and is responsible for research and knowledge that ultimately led to 
the development of modern tests. (From Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics#Victorian_stream)
